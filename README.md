# Main Roads Integrity Analytics Demonstration

This project simulates a simplified end-to-end integrity analytics pipeline tailored for a public sector environment (e.g., road incident auditing, internal access flagging, metadata traceability).

## Features

- Extract–Transform–Load (ETL) pipeline using Python
- Simulated access-level tagging and data masking
- Built-in anomaly detection (e.g., repeated access from same account, time-based irregularities)
- Versioned logging of data changes (audit trail)
- Output-ready CSV for visualization in Power BI or Python

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy)
- SQLite (as lightweight SQL backend)
- Matplotlib for quick dashboarding (can be replaced by Power BI)

🔍 *This project was developed to demonstrate relevant capabilities for the Integrity Analytics Coordinator position at Main Roads WA (May 2025).*
