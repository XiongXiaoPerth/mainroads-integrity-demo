# Main Roads Integrity Analytics Demonstration

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end integrity analytics pipeline designed for public sector applications such as internal audit, incident risk reporting, and stakeholder dashboarding. The project simulates a real-world data pipeline using Python, SQL, and Power BI-compatible outputs.

üîç **This project was created to support my application for the Integrity Analytics Coordinator position at Main Roads WA (May 2025), and highlights my technical capabilities in ETL design, data governance, audit traceability, and cross-functional insight generation.**

## Key Features
